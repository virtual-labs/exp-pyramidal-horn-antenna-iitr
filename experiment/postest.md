B   strengthen the beam to overcome the cosmic noise    
C   make corrections in change of polarization of the beam  
D   select a particular channel in transmission and reception    
<br>

B   Directivity  
C   Beam width    
D   None of these  
<br>

Q3. A \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is a device that converts a guided electromagnetic wave on a transmission line into a plane wave propagating in free space.<br>
